I am user of Apple MacBook Air since 2012 and I must say this is really blazing fast and experience with music also awesome of this magic box. Apple deserve accolade for quality  product.
Macs are synonymous to great battery life now. This laptop was a great purchase since I can work on it all day without charging. Knowing that it has great backup and performance is good to hold it in hand is even better. Was waiting for M4 but then again wait will never be over for best tech. Go for it.
Don't ever buy from amazon with worst support when things are defective
Great product as always
Best Ever
What I have expected from mac that indidnt get but it's quality product and works fast.
I have been using a Mac for almost 8 years now and this is my second one.  Battery wise this is the best laptop that’s out in the market. I don’t play games in the laptop. But my average usage is almost avg. 2 hours per day and I charge the laptop once a week. All apps are perfectly optimised for the Mac. No crashes no issues. MS office works perfectly well. Those coming from windows will take some time to adjust to the usage. Also no fan no noise and no take-off sound.Only con would be - from the base variant itself 16GB should have been provided thinking about the future because once the laptop is purchased most would not purchase again for at least 5 years and beyond.
